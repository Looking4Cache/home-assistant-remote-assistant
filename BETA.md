Hey everyone,

Iâ€™m currently launching theÂ **beta phase**Â of this project:Â **Remote Assistant**Â â€“ a lightweight solution for remote access to your Home Assistant instance. Itâ€™s designed to be simple, secure, and privacy-friendly.

# ðŸ”§Â What is Remote Assistant?

Remote Assistant consists of:

* AÂ **Home AssistantÂ CustomÂ Component**
* AÂ **mobile app**Â (available for Android & iOS)

Once set up, the component and app connect securely via one of my relay servers (located inÂ **Germany**, theÂ **USA**, andÂ **Singapore**) and allow you to access your Home Assistant web interface remotely â€“Â **normally without requiring any manual network setup or complex configuration**.

This project focuses solely onÂ **remote access**Â â€“ no additional features, no accounts, no extra services.

# ðŸ’¡Â Costs

Remote Assistant is financed via InApp purchases. This is only $10 per year, the exact price varies from country to country due to VAT and similar charges. The InApp purchase is only required after some time and then begins with a free trial week.

# ðŸ’¡Â Why I Built This

Iâ€™m a solo developer with a passion for useful, no-nonsense tools. A few years ago, I createdÂ **Remote-RED**for Node-RED, since there were no simple options to access dashboards remotely.

Since then, many users started running Node-RED as Addon inside Home Assistant and use Remote-RED for remote access their HA interface. That inspired me to build something native:Â **Remote Assistant**, using the same concept but designed specifically for Home Assistant.

# ðŸ§ªÂ Join the Beta â€“ Help Me Improve It

Iâ€™m now running aÂ **two-week beta**Â to gather feedback and ensure the system works reliably in a variety of setups.

If you participate and fill out the feedback form, youâ€™ll receiveÂ **1 year of free access**Â as a thank-you for helping shape the project!

# ðŸ‘¤Â About Me

Iâ€™m a one-man dev studio who builds the kind of tools I want for myself. I donâ€™t run ads, I donâ€™t sell data, and I donâ€™t have a marketing team â€“ just code and curiosity.

Thanks for reading â€“ and thanks in advance if you decide to try it!

â€“Â **Thorsten**
